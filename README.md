# Python to "p"

Welcome to the Python to "p" Bash Script repository! This Bash script allows you to create an alias for the `python3` command, enabling you to run Python scripts using a shorter command like `p` or `py`. It aims to simplify your development workflow and enhance your productivity.

## Features:

- Create a custom alias for `python3` with a shorter command like `p` or `py`.
- Execute Python scripts more conveniently and save time.
- Enjoy a seamless and efficient coding experience.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/berdfandrade/python-to-p
   ```

2. ```bash
   cd python-to-p
   ```

3. Make the script executable:
   
   ```bash
   chmod +x python-to-p.sh
   ```

4. Run the script:
   
   ```bash
   ./python-to-p.sh
   ```
   
   The script will prompt you to choose between using "p" or "py" as the alias for the `python3` command. Once set up, you can use the chosen alias as a shortcut for `python3` in your terminal.

## Uninstall:

To remove the alias created by the script, open your terminal, edit your shell's configuration file (`~/.bashrc` for Bash or `~/.zshrc` for Zsh), locate the line that adds the alias, delete or comment it out, save the file, and restart your terminal.
